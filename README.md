# SVG Sprites & More
node: v0.12.2

Environment Setup
Step 1 ) Install the latest version of NodeJS: http://nodejs.org
Note: Make sure you have it installed node.js globally. This will enable you to run npm directives. If you have node and grunt skip to step 3. You can also install node.js via command line with the command - sudo npm install npm -g

Once node is installed you will need to install Grunt : http://gruntjs.com/getting-started The easiest way is to follow these steps: Open your command line tool of choice. PowerShell, Terminal, Bash etc CLI > npm install -g grunt-cli

Excellent! You now have Node and Grunt installed on your system and ready to go.

Step 2 ) Once you are in the project directory, type in the following command: CLI > npm install

Step 3 ) Now all packages have been included into a node_modules directory. Once this is complete we can type grunt into the command line and we are up and running. CLI > grunt

That is it. You can now generate SVG sprites.
