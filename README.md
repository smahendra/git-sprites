# SVG Sprites & More (Auto CSS generation & PNG Fallback)

Environment Setup:
Step 1 ) 
Install the latest version of NodeJS: http://nodejs.org. You can also install node.js via command line with the command below: npm install npm -g (sudo npm install npm -g )
Note: Make sure you have it installed node.js globally. This will enable you to run npm directives. If you have node and grunt skip to step 3.

Step 2)
Once node is installed you will need to install Grunt : http://gruntjs.com/getting-started 
The easiest way is to follow these steps: Open your command line tool of choice. PowerShell, Terminal, Bash etc and run the command below:
CLI > npm install -g grunt-cli

Excellent! You now have Node and Grunt installed on your system and ready to go.

Step 3 ) 
Once you are in the project directory, type in the following command: CLI > npm install (sudo npm install - MAC)

Step 4 ) 
Now all packages have been included into a node_modules directory. Once this is complete we can type grunt into the command line and we are up and running. CLI > grunt

That is it. You can now generate SVG sprites.

tested with - node: v0.12.2 and v0.10.33.
